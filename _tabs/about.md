My name is Armand Mousavi, welcome to my blog. I use the username inzombakura so expect to see that interchangeably. Here I will be making posts about projects I am working on, hackathons I attend, and CTF's that I participate in. 
This is my first post so I will just list out some information about myself.

# Where I have worked:

**Sensors, Energy, and Automation Laboratory (SEAL) at the University of Washington**
* Here I developed the backend API for the registration of IoT devices for the AeroSpec group. The backend completely exists within AWS. I made Lambda functions in Python for AWS operations that I wanted to simplify through a REST API like creating a new thing on IoT core, deleting, or discovering the connection status.
* I also developed the firmware code for the newest featherboards that uploads air quality data neatly into a DynamoDB table using an IoT Rule. 
* Currently, I am developing Bash and Batch scripts for Windows and Linux that compile and upload code to the new featherboards after requested needed information from the user like serial number, wifi SSID + password, and connection certificates + keys.

**House of How**
* Here I worked as a QA tester for games and applications (I can't say what because of non-disclosure agreements). I ran through sequential steps as well as tested in an Ad-Hoc environments.

**Academic Success Center at Bellevue College**
* Back when I went to Bellevue College, I also tutored math for anybody who wanted to drop in or make individual appointments. I tutored pretty much everything up to the end of the calculus series.

# What I am good at:

* I love to use AWS for my cloud services. I have experience with S3 buckets, DynamoDB, IoT, Lambda functions, API gateway, and more.
* My favorite frontend library in JavaScript is React!
* My top three programming languages are Python, Java, and C++. Three tiers for different purposes!
* CTF's and HackTheBox VM's have been educational for me! The three most useful tools for completing them have been the Metasploit Framework, BurpSuite, and CyberChef.

# Extra info:

* I am a novice skateboarder
* You will never find me without my lucky playing card
* Big reader of Homestuck and Vast Error
* My favorite Kombucha brand is Iggy's
